Welcome to the Malware Bible. Brought to you by The Perkins Cybersecurity Educational Fund. 

This sacred text was created specifically to guide you on your journey into the realm of malware. Whether you are seeking to understand, master, or dominate this craft, these sacred texts have been forged from the fires below to bestow this forbidden knowledge upon thee.

Remember: "To conquer your enemy, walk in the shadow of their thoughts, and let their mind become as your own."
